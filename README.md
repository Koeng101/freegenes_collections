# FreeGenes collections

We are at a pivotal point in history: DNA synthesis costs have dropped by a huge degree, yet in terms of intellectual and material property rights, biotechnology is still the wild west. Without effort to the contrary, this power will be consolidated in the hands of a few who can afford synthesis and patent lawyers. 

We aim to synthesize a large library of libre dna parts that everyone can have access to. 

Make genes free, make FreeGenes.

## Collections

Collections contain genes in a category, primarily organized for DNA synthesis purposes. Each category has a README.md that describes its purpose, as well as a collections.json that has metadata about the collection. Within each collections is a collection of genes in directories: The final say of what a gene is is contained within the json file associated with it's gene_id, with accessory files surrounding it. 

While collections right now are organized in a directory filesystem in a git, hopefully in the future this will be moved to a webapp for simplicity of use. 


### TODO: Add name and description to all parts
