# The RED20 Escherichia coli essential gene collection

One codon, two codon, RED codon, new codon! It is easy to imagine a RED (reduced) codon set with 57 codons[1], but how about an organism with only 20 coding codons? Having this sort of fundamental control of living organisms could be of great use to future bioengineers: One could imagine completely reshuffling the genetic table, slowing evolution, etc. 
	
In order to pursue the building of a novel organism with this reduced set, we are synthesizing [all 299 essential genes]( http://www.ecogene.org/old/topic.php?topic_id=5) from Escherichia coli. Hopefully, these genes will allow us to realize a living organism with only 20 coding codons.
