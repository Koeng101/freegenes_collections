# Addgene 20

There are gaps in Addgene's mammalian collection: namely, in the p53 signaling pathway (and complementing pathways). 

Hopefully, the scientific community can use these genes to discover more about the cell cycle and complement pathways to help understand cancer, immune function, and more!
